# Installation Guidelines 

1. Clone the repo using git clone. This might take a while since we have a large codebase with dependencies.

2. Next we have to get into the actual folder to run our React App. To do so do the following,

```bash
# Change directory to BruinRide
cd BruinRide

# Change directory to bruin_ride
cd bruin_ride

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Start the React App
npm start
```

3. The App should work now. Happy travels :)
